  Abstract                 = {{A numerical scheme for finding crack shapes from eddy current measurements has been developed based on a startdard iterative inversion approach in which a nonlinear least squares objective function quantifying the overall difference between predictions and measurements is minimized. In this paper, steepest descent and conjugate-gradient methods for minimizing the objective function are investigated and compared. Cramer-Rao, lower bounds on the crack parameters are derived to quantify the accuracy of the estimated crack shape. Cramer-Rao bounds are also used to indicate improvements in the design of eddy-current nondestructive evaluation systems.}},

Under this framework, spatially distributed observations collected at the sensors form a noisy realization of an underlying random field that has a simple structure with Markovian dependence. We derive iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithms for distributed estimation of the hidden random field from the noisy measurements. We consider both parametric and nonparametric measurement-error models. The proposed distributed estimators are computationally simple, applicable to a wide range of sensing environments, and localized, implying that the nodes communicate only with their neighbors to obtain the desired results. We also develop a calibration method for estimating Markov random field model parameters from training data and discuss initialization of the ICM algorithms. The HMRF framework and ICM algorithms are applied to event-region detection. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.}},

The proposed detectors are derived using the statistical theory of generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) tests and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). We consider both real and complex data models. To allow accurate estimation of the noise covariance, we incorporate secondary data containing only noise into detector design. Probability distributions of the GLR test statistics are derived under the null hypothesis, i.e. assuming that the signal is absent, and used for detector design. We apply the proposed methods to simulated and experimental data and demonstrate their superior performance compared with the detectors that neglect noise correlation.}}

  Abstract                 = {{We derive an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) method for detecting NDE defect signals using hidden Markov random fields (IIMRFs). In the proposed HMRF framework, a set of spatially distributed NDE measurements is assumed to form a noisy realization of an underlying random field that has a simple structure with Markovian dependence. Here, the random field describes the defect signals to be estimated or detected. The HMRF models incorporate measurement locations into the statistical analysis, which is important in scenarios where the same defect affects measurements at multiple locations. We also discuss initialization of the proposed HMRF detector and apply to simulated eddy-current data and experimental ultrasonic C-scan data from an inspection of a cylindrical Ti 6-4 billet.}},

The measurements follow an underdetermined linear model, with noise covariance matrix known up to a constant. To impose sparse or compressible signal structure, we define high- and low-signal coefficients, where each high-signal coefficient is assigned its own variance, low-signal coefficients are assigned 2 common variance, and all the variance components are unknown. Our expansion-compression scheme approximately maximizes a generalized maximum likelihood (GML) criterion, providing an approximate GML estimate of the high-signal coefficient set and an empirical Bayesian estimate of the signal coefficients. We apply the proposed method to reconstruct signals from compressive samples, compare it with existing approaches, and demonstrate its performance via numerical simulations.}},

The squared amplitudes and phases of the potential defect signals are modeled as independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables following gamma and von Mises distributions, respectively. Newton-Raphson iteration is utilized to compute the ML estimates of the unknown parameters. We also compute Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the unknown parameters and discuss initialization of the Newton-Raphson iteration. The proposed method is applied to analyze rotating-probe eddy-current data from steam-generator tube inspection in nuclear power plants. The obtained estimates can be utilized for maximum a posteriori (MAP) signal phase and amplitude estimation, as well as efficient feature extractors in a defect classification scheme. We present numerical examples with both real and simulated data to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We derive a hierarchical Bayesian method for identifying elliptically-shaped regions with elevated signal levels in NDE images. We adopt a simple elliptical parametric model for the shape of the defect region and assume that the defect signals within this region are random following a truncated Gaussian distribution. Our truncated-Gaussian model ensures that the signals within the defect region are higher than the baseline level corresponding to the noise-only case. We derive a closed-form expression for the kernel of the posterior probability distribution of the location, shape, and defect-signal distribution parameters (model parameters). This result is then used to develop Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for simulating from the posterior distributions of the model parameters and defect signals. Our MCMC algorithms are applied sequentially to identify multiple potential defect regions. For each potential defect, we construct Bayesian confidence regions for the estimated parameters. Estimated Bayes factors are utilized to rank potential defects (discovered by our sequential scheme) according to goodness of fit. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated on experimental ultrasonic C-scan data from an inspection of a cylindrical titanium billet.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We study the performance of various beamformers for estimating a current dipole source at a known location using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We present our beamformers in the form of the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC). Under this structure, the beamformer can be solved by finding a filter that achieves the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) between the mainbearn response and filtered observed signal. We express the MMSE as a function of the filter's rank and use it as a criterion to evaluate the performance of the beamformers. We do not make any assumptions on the rank of the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix. Instead, we treat it as low-rank and derive a general expression for the MMSE. We present numerical examples to compare the MSE performance of beamformers commonly studied in the literature: principal components (PCs), cross-spectral metrics (CSMs), and eigencanceler (EIG) beamformers. Our results show that good estimates of the dipole source signals can be achieved using reduced-rank beamformers even for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values.}},
